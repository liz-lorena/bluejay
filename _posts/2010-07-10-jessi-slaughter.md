excerpt: Jessi Slaughter was only 11 years old when she became a "viral Internet meme" back in 2010. Everyone has seen the video where Jessi's father points at the camera and threatens to call "the cyberpolice" on the 4chan trolls who were harassing Jessi. The reason? She was "out of control" online and accused Blood on the Dance Floor singer Dahvie Vanity of raping her. Jessi's online harassment and sexual exploitation took a toll on her and contributed to her developing mental and physical illnesses.
