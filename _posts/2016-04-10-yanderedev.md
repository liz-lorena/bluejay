excerpt: Alex ("YandereDev") is an indie game developer and former industry game programmer known for his <a href="https://yanderedev.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">work-in-progress</a> stealth action video game tentatively titled <a href="https://yanderesimulator.com/" target="_blank">Yandere Simulator</a>. At first his project was very well received by the YouTube gaming community when he started it in 2014. However, years passed with no sign of completion in sight despite receiving a monthly income from Patreon supporters to work full-time on the game, and he began receiving criticism. Soon a mob formed that made fun of his appearance, sent death threats, created hateful content, hacked his subreddit, and spread slanderous pedophilia rumors on social media. Alex claims that the stress from this cyber harassment further delayed the game's completion.
