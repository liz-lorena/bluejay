excerpt: Julie Ayla Patricia Terryberry was a 19 year old woman from Ontario, Canada, who became a target of members on Kiwi Farms who ridiculed her over autism and ADHD, sex work, and her personal relationships. She committed suicide on June 29, 2016. By then, her thread, which started in February of that same year, was over 200 pages long. She is allegedly the first recorded case of suicide as a result of cyberstalking from Kiwi Farms members. There is an article of her on the Lolcow wiki with a summary of the events and a link to her thread. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214020636/https://lolcow.wiki/wiki/Julie_Terryberry" target="_blank">Read it</a> at your own peril.
