excerpt: Christian Weston Chandler (dubbed "Chris-chan" online and currently known as "Christine") is a self-described artist who became known for creating the infamous <a href="https://tapas.io/series/Sonichu" target="_blank">Sonichu</a> webcomic and oversharing his personal life online. Chris's bizarre work and neurological condition sparked a curious obsession in members of the /v/ video game board on 4chan, and his work became the subject of the enormous CWCki website, dedicated to cataloging every detail of his life. Chris's trusting nature was abused by many individuals looking for laughs, but eventually his struggles attracted genuine supporters. So interesting was Chris's story that it inspired the creation of Kiwi Farms, whose founder actually befriended and tried to help Chris. Chris's downward spiral continues to be documented to this day.
