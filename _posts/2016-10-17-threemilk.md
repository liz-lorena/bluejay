excerpt: Agatha ("Threemilk") was an ASMR YouTuber and Twitch variety livestreamer who became the object of obsession for members of the /r9k/ ROBOT9001 board on 4chan. Although her growth may have been thanks to the attention from these members, she became a victim of cyberstalking, with anonymous users doxing her and sharing photos of her in threads while making lewd, homophobic, and anti-Semitic comments. Overwhelmed by this, she deleted all of her social media and videos from her channel - which had amassed <a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/threemilk.html" target="_blank">over 40k subscribers</a> - and disappeared from the public eye to pursue a college degree.
